# Animal Trading Cards

## What is this project for?

This is my first project under Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.

## What does this project show?

The goal of the project is to make an Animal Trading Card. A template was given and the student needs to emulate what the template shows by applying what we've learned in the course. We are free to choose our own animal and designs.

## What did you use to make this project?

This project is made using HTML and CSS.
