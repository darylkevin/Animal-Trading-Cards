			<p>Unlike other marine mammals, the sea otter does not have a layer of blubber to keep it warm, so the sea otter has to rely on its dense fur to keep the cold out. The fur of the sea otter is so thick that no water actually touches the skin of the sea otter. The sea otter's fur also consists of two layers, a waterproof layer of long guard hairs with a layer of short thick fur underneath.</p>
